				"Last Days" items list:<p/>
				<hr/>
				<h2>Weapons</h2>
				<h3>Firearm</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bow</b></div><p/>
				While the name is quite general by our standards it speaks volumes in the wastes. It combines various elements of pre-war weapons technology into a single simplified form. It is used to fire projectiles which are tipped with a metal shard and tailed with a small fuel compartment which is ignited as it is fired. Between the tip and the fuel compartment is a hallow aluminum tube.<p/>
				The Fire Arm is the primary tool of bandits in the waste due to its convenience and surprising accuracy (if assembled correctly).
				<h3>Railgun</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Crossbow</b></div><p/>
				<div class="wip">Under construction!</div>
				<h3>Firearm Projectile</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Arrow</b></div><p/>
				These primitive projectiles are created from propellers and other materials that ensure normal flight. Easy to manufacture, they are very popular in wastes.
				<h3>Car Door</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Shield</b></div><p/>
				<div class="wip">Under construction!</div>
				<h3>Scrap Bat</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Wooden Sword</b></div><p/>
				This blunt club hardly deserves its designation as a weapon, as it can't be used for much more than bludgeoning giant rats to death.
				<h3>Lead Pipe</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Stone Sword</b></div><p/>
				A makeshift weapon made out of a few random pipe sections. Hollow on the inside, painfully stable on the outside.
				<h3>K.O. Sledgehammer</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Iron Sword</b></div><p/>
				The K.O. (Knock-O-Matic) is a sledgehammer with a twist! An inbuilt flywheel conserves momentum when the hammer is moved around. Upon impact the force is unleashed in a second burst, allowing more efficent processing of work pieces and alleviated decapitation of foes.
				<h3>Analytic Probe</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Sword</b></div><p/>
				A multi-purpose tool employed by Orbital Industries scientists, mostly to study various factors of the moons environment. While not a weapon per se, it's capable of giving of low current shocks, intended to determine a substances conductance.<p/>
				Single shocks are ignorable for any healthy human, but present a danger when recieved in large dosages. Packs of mutated scientist, bent on probing places where the sun doesn't shine, should not be trifled with…
				<h3>Cattle Prod</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Diamond Sword</b></div><p/>
				For reasons unknown, some big wheel at Orbital decided that all cocoons should be supplied with a set of cattle prods. With no surviving cattle that would tolerate prodding, the prods can be used as a viable weapon when overcharged with uranium power rods.<p/>
				Just don't touch the buzzing end.
				<h3>L.I.F.E.</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Totem of Undying</b></div><p/>
				This device is the pinnacle of technology ever created by scientists of Redemptionists cult. L.I.F.E. is a series of secret drugs that can save the user from death and, in addition, give a small burst of strength. A very useful thing, especially for those who are not connected to the Respawn system, isn't it?
				<hr/>
				<h2>Pickaxes</h2>
				<h3>Makeshift Pick</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Wodden Pickaxe</b></div><p/>
				It's better than nothing, but this makeshift pick can only get a little scrap metal from cocoons. And that's it.
				<h3>Pick</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Stone Pickaxe</b></div><p/>
				More useful than its makeshift counterpart, but still this pick made of metal is not perfect yet.
				<h3>Hand Drill</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Iron Pickaxe</b></div><p/>
				An manually operated drill and a scavenger's best friend. It opens gearboxes, batteries, safes, wiring and other H.I.V.E. stuff.
				<h3>Rusty Hand Drill</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Pickaxe</b></div><p/>
				Just like the rusty shovel, this tool has seen better days. Fast when drilling through metal walls, it'll break when trying to drill through anything more durable.
				<h3>Micro Activity Nucleus Drill (M.A.N.-Drill)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Diamond Pickaxe</b></div><p/>
				The Micro Activity Nucleus (M.A.N.) drill was developed for and deployed by Orbitals sub-contractor responsible for the construction of the H.I.V.E.s.<p/>
				After the initial excavations for the first cocoons, they met layers of neigh impenetrable rock no one had anticipated.<p/>
				Unable to fulfill their contracts, the contractor went bankrupt but was subsequently bought by Orbital Industries.<p/>
				O.I.'s engineers developed a lightweight, diamond-tipped hand drill in record time. To catch up with schedule, Mr. History authorized the incorporation of costly uranium power rods into the design. This required radiators to be attached to both sides of the drill and makes handling the drill, without protective gear or external cooling, somewhat dangerous.<p/>
				Needless to say that the H.I.V.E. project became a success, unlike Orbitals other big project...
				<hr/>
				<h2>Axes</h2>
				<h3>Makeshift Axe</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Wooden Axe</b></div><p/>
				A makeshift axe that can be used to chop down the bases of trees, scrap shacks and antennas. Better than hands, but is this tool worth it?
				<h3>Axe</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Stone Axe</b></div><p/>
				A full-fledged axe, which is not ashamed to chop materials for shelter. However, there are even better alternatives.
				<h3>Buzz Saw</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Iron Axe</b></div><p/>
				The second best friend for a scavenger after a hand drill. He can chop up an entire abandoned scrap shack village.
				<h3>Fire Axe</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Axe</b></div><p/>
				This axe dates back to the "good old days". Fireproof, it is designed for emergency rescue operations in case of fire. Although effective, but now rusty.
				<h3>Uranium Plasma Cutter</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Diamond Axe</b></div><p/>
				Created by O.I., Uranium plasma cutter at one time was very useful for the construction of antenna facilities. Due to the vibration at high frequencies generated by uranium power rods, this tool greatly facilitates the sawing of trees and other constructions.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Shovels</h2>
				<h3>Digging Plank</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Wooden Shovel</b></div><p/>
				A simple digging plank, weak and fragile. Not exactly the best choice for digging, but better than nothing.
				<h3>Metal Spade</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Stone Shovel</b></div><p/>
				An oversized trowel, more fit for gardening purposes than excavations, but still more useful than the digging plank.
				<h3>Folding Spade</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Iron Shovel</b></div><p/>
				A military grade entrenching tool with telescopic stick. Light, durable, reliable and suitable as weapon of last resort.
				<h3>Rusty Spade</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Shovel</b></div><p/>
				A hand-made tool back from the "good ol' days" before corporations and their mass products took over. While they were crafted quite skillfully and mine any soil at speeds only matched by the MOON Soil Entrencher, their durability has severely deteriorated.
				<h3>MOON Soil Entrencher</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Diamond Shovel</b></div><p/>
				The "MOON Soil Entrencher" is a nuclear powered digging tool, developed by Orbital during the preparations for the Moon landing. When supplied with an uranium power rod the diamond-tipped pan of the shovel begins to vibrate at high frequencies, making loosening the ground much easier.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Hoes</h2>
				<h3>Scrap Wrench</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Wooden Hoe</b></div><p/>
				Scrap wrench, in addition to its direct task, is now intended for ground engineering to plant a water purifier, BEE+ fabricator or other similar device. They also can break some fragile scrap metal. But is it worth saying that makeshift tools are weak?
				<h3>Spanner</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Stone Hoe</b></div><p/>
				Once this tool was used to tighten bolts, now carrots are planted with it. What progress has come to...
				<h3>Wrench</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Iron Hoe</b></div><p/>
				A full-fledged wrench, with which you can twist something, as well as effectively break fragile scrap metal, and plant carrots.
				<h3>Rusty Wrench</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Hoe</b></div><p/>
				Rusty from a long time, the wrench has become a little more efficient, but less durable. Looking at it, some dream of the "good old days" before corporations, before the Event and this nightmare...
				<h3>Cybernetic Ratificator and Allocator for Probes</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Diamond Hoe</b></div><p/>
				Cybernetic Ratificator and Allocator for Probes was designed by Orbital Industries after the Event in order to study ground fertility and search for areas less affected by moondust. Uranium power cores make it easy to cultivate the soil due to high-frequency vibrations.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Armor</h2>
				<h3>Stoneback Leather Armor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Leather Armor</b></div><p/>
				A crude set of clothing made out of the durable hide of the stoneback, for those prefering survival over fashion.<p/>
				After hunting down and skinning a stoneback, the hide needs to be dryed (and if possible tanned) for some time before it can be processed any further.<p/>
				While the smell of the hapless previous skin-owner never quiet dissipates, the armor protects its wearer from minor injuries and harsh weather (excluding lightning).
				<h3>Metal Armor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Iron Armor</b></div><p/>
				A set of mixed sports and work protectors, reinforced with iron plating.<p/>
				The chestpieces can be identified as part of a cocoons rugby equipment, the head part is a welder's helmet.<p/>
				While the metal armor is a preferable alternative over the stoneback armor in direct combat, its ragtag design leaves you open to sneak attacks from behind and provides less protection against the elements.<p/>
				Swimming in this heavy armor is also not advised, should you ever come across a pool of clean water.
				<h3>Mk-235 Armor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Diamond Armor</b></div><p/>
				One of Orbitals more recent developments before the Event, this set of heavy sealed armor provides the wearer with excellent protection against any source of damage*. However it's incredibly hard to come by, let alone, reverse-engineer it.<p/>
				Another problem is the armor's constant need for uranium power rods, otherwise the wearer will be stuck in an unmoving, 200 kg (440 lbs) heavy metal shell, which is quiet a nuisance in a desserted wasteland.<p/>
				The armor should only be worn when needed, otherwise you risk looking like a tool.<p/>
				Oh, and you might contract long-term, third degree radiation burns on the torso and head from the power rods.<p/>
				* The armor is not impervious to sources of concentrated radiation and doesn't come with a rebreather. Go figure.
				<h3>Hazmat Suit</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Armor</b></div><p/>
				In a world plagued by radiation, a protective suit is worth its weight in gold. If only gold was still worth anything.<p/>
				While not the ideal choice for Huggatron hunting, this golden apparel is trusted to protect in irradiated environments, on both the Earth and the Moon!<p/>
				Even today the personel stranded in the Belly still wear a white edition of these suits, keeping them safe from all-<p/>
				Wait... they did mutate, right? Maybe not such a bright idea to invest into a hazmat suit after all...
				<h3>Jane Mail's Armor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Chainmail Armor</b></div><p/>
				A plagiarism of Orbital Industries Mk-235 armor, created after the Event.<p/>
				Trying to make money of the peoples hysteria, a businesswoman named Jane Mail produced cheap, but impressive looking, replicas and sold them at horrendous prices.<p/>
				While durable, they offered hardly more physical protection than a hadware-store-grade hazmat suit.<p/>
				They are hardly ever seen around the wastes and no one ever tried to rebuild one.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Resources</h2>
				<h3>Rare Metals</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Gold Ingot</b></div><p/>
				Certain rare metals are used to treat radiation poisoning, and that's the reason they're so valuable. On Earth, rare metals can be found in safes deep in H.I.V.E.s. On the Moon, in the irradiated Belly itself, they are more common and stored in the form of dust.<p/>
				These materials is actively used by the surviving Moon scientists to treat radiation. For an extreme traveler, this is a great reason to trade.
				<h3>Rare Metal Dust</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Gold Nugget</b></div><p/>
				A small proportion of rare metals used to create anti-radiation medicines.
				<h3>Hydrazine Tank</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Emerald</b></div><p/>
				This substance is actively used by the Masked to create components for their medicines. They get it both from space debris and from scavengers walking around H.I.V.E.s. So, it's time to trade!
				<hr/>
				<h2>Consumable</h2>
				<h3>Clean Water Canteen</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bread</b></div><p/>
				Filled with clean and fresh water, these canteens are perfect for satisfying thirst. Save a few of these for a hike!
				<h3>Tinned Apple</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Apple</b></div><p/>
				Rarely, but you can find food in scrap shacks, thanks to quantum engineers. Apples are never superfluous, are they?
				<h3>Glistering Tinned Apple</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Apple</b></div><p/>
				Apples with an additive of anti-radiation rare metals. Not very tasty, but very healthy!
				<h3>Absolute Antidote Apple (3A.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Enchanted Golden Apple</b></div><p/>
				A very rare type of tinned apples that can be found in some abandoned storages. In addition to rare metals, scientists have added secret medical drugs that no one has yet been able to reproduce. To say that this food is super-healing is to say nothing. And that's why people are ready to do absolutely anything to get at least one such tinned apple.<p/>
				Hide this treasure as securely as possible, don't attract too much attention.
				<h3>Jarred Carrot</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Carrot</b></div><p/>
				Unlike carrots of pre-war times, these are more resistant to radiation and are able to absorb the energy supplied by hydronic batteries for faster growth. They can mostly be found in villages of the Masked.
				<h3>Glistering Jarred Carrot</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Carrot</b></div><p/>
				This carrot, soaked in a dose of rare metals, is an ideal cure for radiation. Alchemists use this ingredient to obtain night vision.
				<h3>B.E.E.+ Pills</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Beetroot</b></div><p/>
				Obtained from BEE+ fabricators, these pills themselves are not very filling. It's better to create overdose of them.
				<h3>Melon Liquor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Melon Slice</b></div><p/>
				Once it was a synthetic nutritious cocktail which was flavoured with watermelon flavouring.  These cheap, slightly tasteless, but nutritious drinks were once supplied by O.I. to the poor countries of the Earth.<p/>
				Hovewer, over time, the flavouring (which was in a rare turn of events made of real sugar, not sweeteners) has fermented into a liquor, which has slightly reduced the nutrition in the cocktail but increased it's enjoyability.<p/>
				After the Event, scavengers can either find boxes of these liquid rations in the antenna facilities, or summon one with the help of a teleportation beacon.
				<h3>Antidote Syrup</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Honey Bottle</b></div><p/>
				Sweet syrup that can be obtained from MedDron3 medical stations. On the one hand, sugar can be extracted from it, which can be used in the manufacture of other medicines. On the other hand, it is very sticky, and this property is very valuable for some structures like traps.
				<h3>Canned Mushroom Mixture</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Mushroom Stew</b></div><p/>
				The mushroom mixture itself, although nutritious, has a slightly unpleasant taste. Of course, this is not what you want to eat, but when there is no food at all...
				<h3>B.E.E.+ Overdose</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Beetroot Soup</b></div><p/>
				Now these BEE+ can satisfy hunger when there are enough of them in the can. Mmm, delicious.
				<h3>Condensed Chaos Capsule</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Chorus Fruit</b></div><p/>
				Capsules of raw chaos. Upon ingestion, open a quantum rift in Null-Space and teleport user a short distance. This ability suggests that they are a part of Anti-Grav Turrets.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
				<h3>Antidote Pump</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Honeycomb</b></div><p/>
				These pumps are the basis of medical stations, the collected material is processed in them and an antidote is made. They can be used to create makeshift stations that work the same way as the original ones.
				<h3>Propeller</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Feather</b></div><p/>
				Cooling device found in the 3M. Can be overclocked to serve as propellant for the Firearm projectiles.
				<h3>Can</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bowl</b></div><p/>
				Although the label on the can reminds of the good old days, it is still empty. What kind of food should it be filled with?
				<h3>Clean Water Dose</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Wheat</b></div><p/>
				Water is the greatest necessity for the human body, and in the conditions of nuclear hell it must be clean. Fortunately, water purifiers are able to give it.
				<h3>Water Purifier</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Wheat Seeds</b></div><p/>
				Water purifier extracts water from the ground and purifies it. There's no more pollution or radiation, it can be safely consumed.<p/>
				Like many other devices manufactured by O.I., water purifiers are able to "self-replicate" so that there's more clean water.<p/>
				After the Event and before the Last War, O.I., before disbanding, created a lot of water purifiers for citizens of all countries. Therefore, they can be found literally all over the wastes.
				<h3>B.E.E.+ Fabricator</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Beetroot Seeds</b></div><p/>
				BEE+ fabricators, created for medical purposes, form special compounds from soil nutrients, consisting of one-third of vitamin B, two-thirds of vitamin E plus a few additives.<p/>
				Like water purifiers, fabricators are able to "self-replicate".
				<h3>Supply Beacon</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Melon Seeds</b></div><p/>
				The very first development in quantum engineering, these teleportation beacons served as humanitarian aid for developing and poor countries. Due to their experimental nature, random defects and disruptive background radiation reassembly process of the teleported good takes some time.
				<h3>TV Supply Beacon</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Pumpkin Seeds</b></div><p/>
				The same as an ordinary supply beacon, but instead of food it delivers TV.
				<h3>Antenna Parts</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bamboo</b></div><p/>
				Antenna Parts were used as the main material for building of antenna facilities.
				<h3>Hydronic Battery</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bone Meal</b></div><p/>
				This type of batteries contains active chemicals that in their raw form accelerate growth of organics. In the form of energy, they are suitable for charging various machine things, like "In-The-Box" items or self-"replicating" stuff.<p/>
				Batteries can be obtained by robbing bandits (for them this item is very valuable) or by using a special hydronic extractor.
				<h3>Glistering Melon Liquor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Glistering Melon Slice</b></div><p/>
				Melon liquor is ideal for creating an anti-radiation injection using rare metals dust. However, to use this item, alchemy is required.
				<h3>M.N.P. Tape</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bottle o' Enchanting</b></div><p/>
				Primitive and inefficient, but at least some way to collect M.N.P. particles used by the Masked. It's based on magnetic tapes in cassettes of the Old World.
				<h3>M.N.P. Encoded File</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Enchanted Book</b></div><p/>
				Books are the most popular and affordable way to encode "enchantment" using M.N.P. Later, this code can be applied to a specific item in order to change its properties.<p/>
				These books are sacred to the cults of The One, because, as they believe, the words with which their God created the world are written in them.
				<h3>Croc Co. Power Core</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ender Pearl</b></div><p/>
				Croc Co. Power Core is the first device created by Dr. Crocopolous within the Croc Co. project.<p/>
				It's connected with V.B.T.W., thereby allowing Experiments to teleport. But for an ordinary person to use it, he must throw the Core to the place where he wants to move. However, this thing harms the health of the thrower.
				<h3>Charged Croc Co. Power Core</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ender Eye</b></div><p/>
				Creation a Charged version of Croc Co. Power Core requires loading a little helium-3 into an uncharged one. They are needed to search for portal signatures emitted by illegal H.I.V.E.s.<p/>
				To use the Charged Croc Co. Power Core, one need to throw it so that it flies up in the direction of the portal. Either it will spend all the energy of the flight and fall, or it may break irrevocably.<p/>
				Also, these devices are needed to activate an interdimensional portal in the illegal H.I.V.E.
				<h3>Mad Dragon's Breath</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Dragon Breath</b></div><p/>
				This gas is contained in HIS projectiles and can be collected in bottles for further use in alchemy. Potion grenades created on the basis of Breathing will have a lingering sticky effect.
				<h3>Stabilised Chaos Capsules</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Popped Chorus Fruit</b></div><p/>
				Stabilised by heat, these Chaos Capsules no longer open Null-Space quantum rifts and can even be used as building materials.
				<h3>Anti-Grav Turret Fragment</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Shulker Shell</b></div><p/>
				A fragment of casing from an Anti-Grav Turret. It is used in the construction of Quantum Storages.
