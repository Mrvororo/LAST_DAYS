				"Last Days" structures list:<p/>
				<hr/>
				<h2>Surface</h2>
				<h3>Bandit Hideout</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Jungle Temple</b></div><p/>
				Bandits, being humans themselves, needed some form of shelter in this hostile world. So, using scrap metal found throughout the wastes, they built small hideouts scattered throughout abandoned antenna facilities. Being the skeptical little buggers they are, they filled their new hideouts to the brim with traps and other nefarious devices to stop anyone from getting at their "hard earned" loot.<p/>
				Over time, the prevalent vines and other plant life in the antenna facilities have covered the hideouts, making them harder to spot, much to the delight of the bandits that built them.
				<h3>Field Lab</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Swamp Hut</b></div><p/>
				When one of the Masked has been coned and shunned from the village (colour of the traffic cone depends on the offense that he or she committed), some of them tend to flee to the swamps and live a reclusive life inside one of these elveated labs over irridiated water. Thanks to the protective clothing, Outcasts can tolerate swamp's polluted landscape for a long time.<p/>
				The field labs were constructed after the Event, to research the effects of the radiactive moon dust and its effects on the ecosystem. The original researchers have long since become part of the Lost, but their equipment, notes and chemistry books remained. This allows the Outcasts to practice a crude alchemy and they get very excited, when people trespass in their irradiated paradise, because it finally gives them an opportunity to test out their latest deadly concoction on an unwilling test subject.
				<h3>Drilling Rig</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Desert Temple</b></div><p/>
				Before the Event, these desert structures housed massive drills, that bored into the earth in search of oil or other precious materials. The drills have long been either destroyed or salvaged, leaving the rigs open for bandits and all other sorts of things to make them their homes, but bandits, being who they are, like to put nefarious traps around their goodies stored away in the old drilling shaft.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Ocean</h2>
				<h3>Scientific Underwater Base Merge (S.U.B.merge)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ocean Monument</b></div><p/>
				SUBmerges are O.I. scientific bases located underwater, researching the consequences of the Event. SUBmarines, underwater robots that collect information about water pollution have been designed for this purpose. But their goals include not only research, but also the protection of the base from unidentified persons.<p/>
				However, if the protection is passed, they can find unique water valves that collect water around, and the rare metals storage.
				<hr/>
				<h2>H.I.V.E.</h2>
				<h3>Hall Impenetrable Vault Environment (H.I.V.E.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Caves</b></div><p/>
				H.I.V.E. (or the satirical name H.E.L.L.) once served as a shelter for millions of people hiding from a potential nuclear war, but now it is a natural hell.<p/>
				It can be said that H.I.V.E. is a separate world with its own rules, laws and customs. These're complexes of underground shelters called "Cocoons", clustered together into a single and safe environment.<p/>
				O.I. started building H.I.V.E. in 7 B.E. in case of possible nuclear conflicts. At first, normal technical methods were used, which didn't require any quantum engineering, until there were too many people who wanted to settle in cocoons. And then the matter-reintegrating goo (M.R.G.) was created.<p/>
				This substance, with an external supply of energy, is able to absorb matter and replace it with a certain material that was supplied from O.I. storage facilities through Null-portals (this is how the "In-The-Box" system works, for example). Thanks to M.R.G., O.I. could afford two levels of H.I.V.E: upper (U.-H.I.V.E.) and lower (L.-H.I.V.E.). The second was more durable, but more expensive in price.<p/>
				However, the Event and the Last War made H.I.V.E.s uninhabitable: radiation, consequences from earthquakes, flood, etc. Among the benefits: unattended resources like batteries, metal gears, etc. Do you want to go to this H.E.L.L.?
				<h3>B-Class Hall Monitor Test Site</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Abandoned Mineshaft</b></div><p/>
				Before The Event, there was no proper test site for B-Class Hall Monitors, so maze-like hallways were quickly constructed in selected H.I.V.E.s, to test the new Hall Monitor prototypes.<p/>
				The O.I. engineers requested builders to leave behind their scaffolding and toolboxes (which contain building materials, tools and builders' lunch) in order to test the B-Class Hall Monitor's ability to fit in tight spaces. The halls also provided an opportunity to test out the B-Class Hall Monitors ability to lay down blockades of barbwire.<p/>
				After The Event, these test sites still have B-Class Hall Monitors crawling around in them and are the best place for anyone wanting to see them in action.
				<h3>Bandit Bunker</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Dungeon</b></div><p/>
				After war, bandits living underground began to make bunkers, to store their loot and protect themselves from aboveground hazards. Spelunking further and further, they started to find Hall Monitor Test Sites, filled with O.I. duplicators. Luckyli for other scavengers, bandits mostly took these powerful machines first, to reinforce defense of their underground hideouts (leaving other resources and making Test Sites safer).<p/>
				Unlucky for bandits, having no idea how replicators work, they were eaten by hordes of Lost, ripped by Hall Monitors or pulped to death by their clones. If you are brave enough, you can try to retrive some of basic supplies, alongside with music catridges and gear for your H.O.R.S.
				<h3>Anti Light Radiation Salt Crystals Chamber (A.L.R.S.C.C.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Amethyst Geode</b></div><p/>
				O.I. thought about a special glass that can protect people from light radiation. For this purpose, lots of crystal chambers were created in H.I.V.E.s for the growth of special reflective salt crystals (R.S.C.).<p/>
				Due to their properties, some have managed to make a telescope out of these crystals.
				<h3>Illegal H.I.V.E.</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Stronghold</b></div><p/>
				These illegal H.I.V.E.s were built on the personal order of Dr. Crocopolous as part of the Croc Co project.<p/>
				For an ordinary scavenger, this is not a simple H.I.V.E., but a place where it is possible to find many treasures and miraculously surviving records of various kinds of experiments.<p/>
				However, in one room, protected by a O.I. Rust Roach duplicator, there is an interdimensional portal leading directly into the Realm of Madness. It seems like a one-way ticket, doesn't it?
				<hr/>
				<h2>The Moon</h2>
				<h3>Moonlab</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Nether Fortress</b></div><p/>
				Moonlabs were created under Moon's surface to develop and test nuclear weapons sold by O.I. to Earth's superpowers. After the Event, they are most dangerous places, full of He-3 Excavators and Construction Robots. For scavengers, these buildings contain very rare loot, like uranium rods or H.O.R.S. armor prototype.
				<h3>Fortification Remnant</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bastion Remnant</b></div><p/>
				When the scientists were expelled from Moonlabs, they began to need a safe haven. Using durable materials from large dumps, they built fortifications that they thought would ensure peace and prosperity for them and their descendants. But it turns out those robots took them seriously.<p/>
				In that great war, G.O.R.T. was used, which left only ruins of the fortifications. At a high price, but they won back their homes and drove the invaders back. Those were the days...
				<hr/>
				<h2>Realm of Madness</h2>
				<h3>C.H.R.U.-5</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Chorus Plant</b></div><p/>
				C.H.R.U.-5 are strange devices that can be found all over RoM Expanse. The main part is often called a "flower" and is the head of the device. It appears to absorb the very fabric of the Realm of Madness itself and leaves behind a trail of congealed chaos. It is highly probable to be quantum in nature, sometimes splits into two devices on it's own. However, after extended operation, the heads become clogged and require manual resetting.
				<h3>RoM Research Labs</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>End City</b></div><p/>
				RoM research labs are spread all over the RoM Expanse. They resemble a branching tree and its houses look like pagodas. Created to study the properties of the Realm of Madness, they contain valuable treasures and stuff.<p/>
				These constructions are protected by Anti-Grav Turrets. Do not approach them if you are afraid of heights.<p/>
				Some of these labs have flying ships with them. Considering the bow of this ship, it somehow feels uncomfortable that serving HIM has turned into something like a religion. Each such vessel is necessarily equipped with a Gliderpack, for which many are willing to pay a lot of money.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Custom buildings</h2>
				<h3>C/H.U.N.K.S.</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Multiplayer Spawn</b></div><p/>
				While the combined might of the planets countries may have succeeded in dismantling O.I., many countries weren't willing to take any risks.<p/>
				Recruiting volunteers for thier C.o.G. programs, these countries sealed away hundreds of the worlds best and brightest in highly experimental C/H.U.N.K.S. facilities designed to activate these highly trained and motivated individuals in the case of a complete Governmental failure of world-ending porportions.<p/>
				Unfortunately, many of these hastily constructed and highly sophisticated (read "Unreliable") machines failed to load properly on activation, leading to thier occupants waking up sealed in their tubes until the onboard oxygen supply inevitably failed. Or the liquid nitrogen that kept these people preseved would fail to drain as the revival process happened. Worse still, these sites became highly sought after AE on account of caches of goods left for the engineers and scientists and craftspersons in order for them to carry out thier solemn task of jump-starting society.<p/>
				If a volunteer beat the odds of mechanical failure, oftentimes they would wake up in a raided facility with nothing left in thier C.o.G. crates but a handful of breadcrusts and a cheap hatchet.<p/>
				However, people will be lucky if they wake up in C/H.U.N.K.S., attached to the Respawn system. The main thing is that it should be a legal connection, otherwise this function may not work.
